# Trigger Pipeline

This project creates a small stand alone binary for triggering pipelines in [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) servers that are setup and managed via GitOps and the [Jenkins Operator](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/)

It helps bridge the gap between [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) and [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) around ChatOps.
